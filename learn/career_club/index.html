<h2>What is sustainability?</h2><b>[ 15 sec video of a location you can visit ]</b>
<p>For me, sustainability is <span id="toyou_">the efficient use of finite resources of our planet</span>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation is <span id="respect_">creating feedback cycles</span>.</p>
<p>We can have the above, but we still won’t have sustainability.</p>

<h2>Why isn’t sustainability sustainable?</h2><b>[ 20 sec video of a group of people ]</b>
<p>Think about it.  Sustainability make things cheaper, more efficient and produces less waste, but <span id="asyou_">we don't have people lining up for them</span>.</p>
<p>Same as sustainable projects which can solve problems, otherwise <span id="changethis_">we owe it for our future generations</span>, but we aren't joining or starting them now.</p> 
<p>We need to answer why isn’t sustainability sustainable? There isn’t a lack of solutions.  There is a lack of adoption and participation.</p> 

<h2><span id="tohelp_">Design of a marketplace</span></h2><b>[ 30 sec video of work you do ]</b>
<p>Did you know, <span id="similar_">at just one environmental conference there were over 800 sustainable solutions with more than 500 companies</span>.</p>
<p>The missing piece could very well be <span id="why_">a marketplace where solutions and projects can be listed with clear incentives and outcomes</span>.</p>
<p>This is bigger than me, <span id="benefit_">it’s a platform for Makers and Users, Teachers and Learners, Checkers and Risk Takers with different interest and aspiration, connecting and doing things more sustainably for our planet and for ourselves</span>. 

<h2><span id="interests_">A global collaborative platform with local roots</span></h2><b>[ 30 sec of something or a couple of things fun you do ]</b>
<p>People might not see sustainability as something fundamentally different from what’s most of us have been comfortable with, that is, we are used to be stakeholders watching out for their own interests.</p>
<p>But the better way is to have fun doing it, that's why I like <span id="interests_">collaborate by aligning strategies and common goals, to build trust and connecting the right people, basically what the internet is designed for</span>.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own interests, but when we collaborate and combine it with sustainability, we can all make an impact.</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2><b>[ 30 sec video of a company you want to work for ]</b>
<p>My goal is to help people understand sustainability.  As the term becomes more and more common place, they can judge for themselves how that will affect them and what they should pay attention to, so that we can all be inclusive in this newly developing network that will ultimately transform how we work and live.</p> 
<p><span id="quote_">Let’s adopt sustainable technologies and participate in sustainable projects not only because we have to but because it’s profitable.</span></p> 
<b>[ fadeout to sustaincia as appreciation for their help in creating this video ]</b>
<p>At Sustaincia, we launch sustainability.</p>
