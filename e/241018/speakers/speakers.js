The increasing global concern over plastic waste and its environmental impact, Sio sought an alternative that would also address the growing tea-drinking culture and the resulting tea waste. Chazence was born from this vision, aiming to reduce tea waste through a unique, vegan-friendly material. The company uses patented tea upcycling technology to create furniture and everyday, useful decor items, offering a bio-based material that serves as a sustainable alternative to plastic. This initiative supports the environment by reducing the disposal of plastic waste and also taps into the cultural significance of tea, transforming its byproducts into valuable, eco-friendly products. Chazence is continually engaged in research to expand the application of this technology across various industries, aiming to provide a complete vegan-based alternative to toxic materials. Through this work, Calvin Sio and his company are keen on developing practical, sustainable solutions that cater to both environmental needs and modern consumer lifestyles.
